# OpinionOrganisers Project

## Course project for ICCS-311 T2 2022

The goal of our project is to develop a sentiment analysis program "Movie Mood" that reads through multiple reviews about a given topic and returns a positive:negative ratio. The program will use a large dataset of positive and negative English words to identify sentiment. Parallelism will be used to navigate and read through the reviews, while concurrency will be used to sum the total positivity and negativity words by checking the dataset.


The program will be implemented using Rust, a fast and efficient programming language, which is well-suited for parallel and concurrent programming. We aim to demonstrate 
our understanding of functional programming principles and parallel programming techniques by developing a scalable and modular program that can handle large datasets and
multiple languages in the future.


We recognize that the approach may not be perfect due to the possibility of sarcasm and ambiguity in language. Nonetheless, we believe that this project will provide 
valuable experience in functional and parallel programming, which can be applied to various applications in the future.
